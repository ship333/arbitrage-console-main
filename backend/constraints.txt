# Editable constraints template (optional).
# Use to pin wheel-friendly versions or document platform markers.
# Example pins (uncomment and adjust as needed):
# numpy==2.0.1
# pandas==2.2.2
#
# If a native dep like TA-Lib is present in your requirements.txt and fails on Windows,
# prefer adding a platform marker in requirements.txt instead of trying to "exclude" via constraints:
# ta-lib==0.4.28 ; sys_platform != 'win32'
#
# Then install with:
#   pip install --prefer-binary --only-binary=:all: -c backend/constraints.txt -r backend/requirements.txt
